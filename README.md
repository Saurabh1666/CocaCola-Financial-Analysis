# CocaCola-Financial-Analysis
As part of a consulting project at Royal Holloway, University of London, I conducted a comprehensive financial analysis of The Coca-Cola Company over a decade, focusing on identifying trends, diagnosing challenges, and developing strategic recommendations to enhance profitability and market sustainability. Using descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, I analyzed key financial metrics such as revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, and stock price trends, employing Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I developed predictive models to forecast stock prices and assessed the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and commodity price volatility, on financial performance. The project culminated in a detailed 10,000-word consulting report outlining actionable strategies for cost optimization, market expansion, and operational efficiency. Key insights included identifying emerging market opportunities, emphasizing sustainability initiatives, and showcasing the predictive power of profitability metrics over revenue growth. This project enhanced my financial analytics skills, predictive modeling expertise, and ability to translate complex data into strategic business recommendations.
